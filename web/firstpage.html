      The land we now know as Iran has had many letters throughout history. You may have heard the name Persia and Iran from the past, but it is interesting to know that the Aryans called their land Irio Deinghunam or Ariushinem, which meant Aryans. Later, with the establishment of the government, their homeland was called Iriano Khoshtar, meaning the kingdom of the Iranians, which was later changed to Iran Shatr or Iranshahr. Iran is abbreviated to the same name. The Iranians considered their land to be Iran for thousands of years, but the Europeans never used the name until three hundred years ago, using the word Persia instead. Reza Shah Pahlavi was the one who decided to change the official name of our country to Iran. His goal was to wield power throughout the country, a country of high ethnic and cultural diversity. Reza Shah's government in 1313 AD announced to foreign governments that from now on only the name "Iran" will be used to refer to this country. On April 1, 1314, according to the directive of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the name of the country was changed to Iran in official correspondence from Persia and Persia. Archaeological findings date the presence of various human species in the current geography of Iran to the Paleolithic period. In the Mesolithic period, Neanderthals lived in the Zagros. 40 thousand years ago humans arrived in Iran, people in this age (Neolithic) be made in the form of blades tools and their works near Shiraz, Kermanshah, Khorramabad, Golpayegan, Hafshejan, <a class="underline" href="Kashan.html">Kashan </a>been found . Artifacts from the next period called the Paleolithic (Zarzi culture) have been found in the north of Alborz and the western part of Zagros. Before the Median period, there were very bright and great civilizations in Iran that we often ignore. burnt City(With the world's oldest animation, the world's first brain surgery 4800 years ago, the world's first artificial eye, 12 different textures) is one of the reasons that the Burnt city which at the time was considered a very prosperous and advanced city. Has gained worldwide fame. Silk Hill About 5500 years before history, it is one of the other prehistoric civilizations of Iran, which is in fact a ziggurat-shaped shrine, and in its first layers, metal smelting furnaces, signs of raising domestic animals, many spinning and weaving spindles have been found. And in the final periods, there is a lot of progress in the Silk Hill civilization. The civilization of Tappeh Gyan, the civilization of Jiroft, the civilization of Urartu, the civilization of the Kassis and the Elamites were also among the most advanced civilizations of the world in their time. The Medes settled in the land of the Medes in western Iran in the 17th century BC. The Medes ruled the largest kingdom in West Asia during Hokhshtar's reign, and Hokhshtar can be considered the founder of the first Iranian power. The Median government was the first government based on the unity of different ethnic groups living on the Iranian plateau, an event that can be considered the greatest event in the history of Iran. The Achaemenids (perhaps the most famous Persian dynasty) came to power after the defeat of the Medes by Cyrus the Great and conquered a large part of the world. The Achaemenids are the first empire in the world to extend their rule from 550 BC to 330 BC, ruling from the Indus to the Danube in Europe, as well as from Central Asia to northeastern Africa. <a class="underline" href="perspolis.html">Persepolis</a>of the largest remnants of the Achaemenids. With Alexander's invasion of Iran, the Achaemenids collapsed and the Seleucids (one of Alexander's commanders) ruled Iran from 32 to 64 BC. The Parthians (Parthians) destroyed the Seleucids by expanding their influence. The Parthian Empire extended from the Euphrates River to the Hindu Kush and from the Caucasus Mountains to the Persian Gulf but was weakened by repeated wars with Rome. The Sassanids, who came to power after the Parthians, united Iran for the first time after the Achaemenids. With the Arab invasion of Iran, Iran was under non-Iranian rule for many years. Taherian was the first Iranian government after the Arab invasion of Iran.<a class="underline" href="Neyshapor.html">Neyshapor</a> It was the capital of the Taherians and Sistan and part of Transoxiana under their rule. The Saffarids, led by Yaqub Laith Saffari, came to power with the weakness of the Taherian government and occupied parts of Iran. The other Samanids were the Iranian dynasty that conquered Khorezm, Kerman, Hyrkan, Makran, Sistan and Khorasan and ruled these lands from 874 to 1004 AD. Al-Ziyar and Al-Buwayh ruled two small Persian dynasties between 928 and 1043 AD and 934 to 1055 AD, respectively.Ghaznavids, a Turkish state, laid the first urban foundations in Ghazni and became known as the Ghaznavids. The father of Sultan Mahmud of Ghaznavid was a Turkish slave who was bought during the Samanid period to serve them. Many conquests were made by this dynasty in India, their official language was Persian, and they gave great importance to Persian language poets in this period. The Seljuks, who were the Turks of Ghazni, were overthrown by Tughral Beyk and defeated by Sultan Massoud of Ghazni. The Seljuks ruled from 1307 to 1194 AD. The Khwarezmshahis, Ilkhanids, and Timurids also came to power before the Safavid period. The Safavid period, when Shiites were chosen as the official religion of the country, lasted from 1501 to 1722. The Safavids are one of the most important dynasties of Iran because a centralized Iranian ruler after 900 years was able to bring Iran under one command. Afshari, Zandieh, Qajar, Pahlavi were other dynasties in Iran that became extinct with the Islamic Revolution of 1978.
