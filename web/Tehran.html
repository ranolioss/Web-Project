Tehran is an amazing combination of a city with a modern, traditional and strong structure, which has been the capital of Persia for thousands of years. The city used to have four neighborhoods, Sangalaj, Oudlajan, Bazaar and Chaleh Maidan, then new neighborhoods were added to it during the reign of Nasser al-Din Shah: such as Arg, Khaniabad, Javadiyeh, Pachnar, Pamanar and God Arabha. Meanwhile, the sights of Tehran are one of the most attractive parts of the capital, where all the residents of this city and tourists touring Tehran, as well as foreign tourists usually spend time in those areas. Tehran is the result of a homogeneous combination of ancient buildings, magnificent mosques, luxurious mansions, refined parks and modern buildings, and no one gets bored. Although Tehran is not now known as a historical city, but visiting it by visiting its various attractions is a pleasure that should not be missed.
